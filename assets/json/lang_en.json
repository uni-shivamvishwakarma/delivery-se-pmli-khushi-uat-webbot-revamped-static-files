				"queries": [
					{
						"query": "Are the points taxable?",
						"response": "As per the Indian Taxation Laws, an aggregate of award amount of Rs.5,000 & below , within the same Financial Year (April-March) will be exempted from income tax in India. However, any aggregated award amount, over and above Rs.5,000 within the same Financial Year (April-March), will be taxable. \nFor Example: If an employee A receives Rs. 4,000 as an award amount in the month of Jun 2020, there will be no tax deducted. However , if the employee A receives an additional award of Rs. 2,000 in Dec 2020 , the aggregate award amount for the FY is Rs 6,000 (4,000 + 2,000). Hence the additional amount of Rs.1,000 will be taxable. Tax will be deducted in the following month via payroll."
					},
					{
						"query": "Can I convert the points into cash?",
						"response": "No, the points cannot be converted into cash, except for any medical emergencies (Please contact your Tower Leaders for exceptions related to medical emergencies). The Kudos platform has amazing options to choose from and we would encourage you to leverage the available discounts. If you are looking for a particular brand/product etc., you can also request the Advantage Club team (through the Kudos platform) to work on your requirements and they will try their best to enable the deals for the same. There is an ‘I Want’ feature on the platform to enable brand recommendations."
					},
					{
						"query": "When do the points expire?",
						"response": "Points don't have any expiry date until you are working in the same corporate, although the brand vouchers redeemed using these points have a certain expiry date which eventually depends on the brand itself."
					},
					{
						"query": "Can the employee transfer the points to their colleagues?",
						"response": "Yes, the employees can give points to their colleagues as gifts. It will be solely on the discretion of the employee."
					},
					{
						"query": " Is there a limit to non- monetary awards/ appreciation?",
						"response": "No, there is no limit to appreciation. We encourage you to recognise your colleagues on a frequent basis to keep them motivated."
					},
					{
						"query": "Can I mark my manager/ tower leaders while initiating a monetary/non- monetary award?",
						"response": "Yes, you can cc your managers/ tower leaders while appreciating or awarding your colleagues."
					},
					{
						"query": "When will the employee be notified about the award?",
						"response": "SOnce the Approver 2 gives approval, the employee will get an award directly."
					},
					{
						"query": "What are Classifieds?",
						"response": "Classifieds is the 'buy and sell' feature. Through this you will be able to post an advertisement with all the details and descriptions of the product which will only be visible to the employees. They can click on 'buy at the price'. The user's details will be shared with the owner of the product and then the owner can contact the buyer at his own convenience. This feature is much more reliable than any similar features available in the market."
					},
					{
						"query": "How can points be redeemed on the Advantage Club portal?",
						"response": "Click on the ‘Redeem’ feature on the Home Page. You’ll be able to see various brands from different categories here. Use your reward points to redeem them on any brand of your choice. While redeeming something higher than the number of points, users can pay the balance using their credit card/debit card or Internet Banking."
					},
					{
						"query": "When does wishing Button show up on the buzz page?",
						"response": "The wish button gets populated on the day of Birthday and Work Anniversary. Clicking on that triggers an automated mail to the employee stating that you wished him."
					},
					{
						"query": "What is the 'work anniversary award' flow ?",
						"response": "If it's your Work Anniversary you will receive an automated mailer wishing you Happy work Anniversary from Otis Family."
					},
					{
						"query": "What are the exit scenarios/policy for Otis Hub employees?",
						"response": "The points will expire after employment ends for an employee. We request the employees to redeem their points during the notice period to avoid losing them post employment ends."
